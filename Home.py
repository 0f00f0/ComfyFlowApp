                        ### Why You Need ComfyFlowApp? 
                        If you need to share workflows developed in ComfyUI with other users, ComfyFlowApp can significantly lower the barrier for others to use your workflows:
                        - Users don't need to understand the principles of AI generation models. 
                        - Users don't need to know the tuning parameters of various AI models. 
                        - Users don't need to understand where to download models. 
                        - Users don't need to know how to set up ComfyUI workflows. 
                        - Users don't need to understand Python installation requirements.
                        
                        ComfyFlowApp helps application developers make these complexities transparent to users, who can use it like any other regular application.
