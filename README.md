## ðŸ“Œ What is ComfyFlowApp?

ComfyFlowApp is an extension tool for ComfyUI, making it easy to create a user-friendly application from a ComfyUI workflow and lowering the barrier to using ComfyUI.

As shown in the images below, you can develop a web application from the workflow like "portrait retouching"

### Why You Need ComfyFlowApp?

If you want to generate an image using AI tools, you can choose MidJourney, DALL-E3, Fairfly (Adobe), or similar tools. These tools allow anyone to generate a beautiful image based on prompts. However, if you need more control over the generated results, like dressing a model in specific clothing, these tools may not suffice. Additionally, if your scenario has specific copyright requirements for images, you can use the open-source Stable Diffusion to build an AI image processing application. You have the choice of Stable-Diffusion-WebUI or ComfyUI, with WebUI being simple to use and having a rich plugin ecosystem for various processing needs. On the other hand, ComfyUI has a higher learning curve but offers more flexible workflow customization, allowing you to develop workflows for a wide range of scenarios.

If you need to share workflows developed in ComfyUI with other users, ComfyFlowApp can significantly lower the barrier for others to use your workflows:

- Users don't need to understand the principles of AI generation models.
- Users don't need to know the tuning parameters of various AI models.
- Users don't need to understand where to download models.
- Users don't need to know how to set up ComfyUI workflows.
- Users don't need to understand Python installation requirements.


**In summary, ComfyFlowApp make comfyui workflow easy to use.**
